There are other ways to get data into Galaxy (not covered in this tutorial): you can upload a file from your computer, and you can import an entire history.\n\n\nChoose a tool and change any settings for your analysis.\n\n\nRun the tool. The output files will be saved at the top of your history.\n\n\nView the output files by clicking on the eye icon.\n\n\nView all your histories and move files between them. Switch to a different history.\n\n\nLog out of your Galaxy server. When you log back in (to the same server), your histories will all be there.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nWell done!

            "text": "RNA-Seq: Bacteria\n\n\nThis tutorial is about using RNA-seq data to investigate differential gene expression in bacteria, using Galaxy tools and Degust (a tool on the web).\n\n\nNew to Galaxy?\n First try the \nintroduction\n and then learn some \nkey tasks\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nDifferential Gene Expression (DGE) is the process of determining whether any genes were expressed at a different level between two conditions. For example, the conditions could be wildtype versus mutant, or two growth conditions. Usually multiple biological replicates are done for each condition - these are needed to separate variation within the condition from that between the conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nInput data: reads and reference\n\n\nRNA-Seq reads\n\n\nA typical experiment will have 2 conditions each with 3 replicates, for a total of 6 samples.\n\n\n\n\nOur RNA-seq reads are from 6 samples in \nFASTQ\n format.\n\n\nWe have single-end reads; so one file per sample.\n\n\nData could also be paired-end reads, and there would be two files per sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese have been reduced to 1% of their original size for this tutorial.\n\n\nThe experiment used the bacteria \nE. coli\n grown in two conditions.\n\n\nFiles labelled \nLB\n are the wildtype\n\n\nFiles labelled \nMG\n have been exposed to 0.5% \nMG - alpha methyglucoside (a sugar solution).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference genome\n\n\nThe reference genomes is in \nFASTA\n format and the gene annotations are in \nGTF\n format.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nFASTA\n file contains the DNA sequence(s) that make up the genome; e.g. the chromosome and any plasmids.\n\n\nThe \nGTF\n file lists the coordinates (position) of each feature. Commonly-annotated features are genes, transcripts and protein-coding sequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpload files to Galaxy\n\n\n\n\nLog in to your Galaxy instance (for example, Galaxy Australia, \nusegalaxy.org.au\n).\n\n\nCreate a new history for this analysis.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using Galaxy Australia:\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nShared Data: Data Libraries\n.\n\n\nClick on \nRNA-Seq-data\n, then Import.\n\n\nThe files should now be in your current history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively\n, you can obtain the data from Zenodo:\n\n\n\n\nIn a new browser tab, go to this webpage:\n\n\n\n\nFor each file, right click on file name: select \ncopy link address\n\n\nIn Galaxy, go to \nGet Data\n and then Upload File\n\n\nClick \nPaste/Fetch data\n\n\nA box will appear: paste in link address\n\n\nClick \nStart\n\n\nClick \nClose\n\n\nThe file will now appear in the top of your history panel.\n\n\nRepeat for all files in Zenodo.\n\n\nChange (shorten) the file names with the pencil icon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlign reads to reference\n\n\nThe RNA-Seq reads are fragmented and are not complete transcripts.

The control/treatment samples should be split along this axis.\n\n\nOur LB samples are on the left and the MG samples are on the right, which means they are well separated on their major MDS dimension, which looks correct.\n\n\n\n\nExpression - MA plot\n\n\nEach dot shows the change in expression in one gene.\n\n\n\n\nThe average expression (over both condition and treatment samples) is represented on the x-axis.\n\n\nPlot points should be symmetrical around the x-axis.\n\n\nWe can see that many genes are expressed at a low level, and some are highly expressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fold change is represented on the y axis.\n\n\nIf expression is significantly different between treatment and control, the dots are red. If not, they are blue. (In Degust, significant means FDR \n0.05).\n\n\nAt low levels of gene expression (low values of the x axis), fold changes are less likely to be significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the dot to see the gene name.     \n\n\n\n\nExpression - Parallel Coordinates and heatmap\n\n\nEach line shows the change in expression in one gene, between control and treatment.\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nOptions\n at the right.\n\n\nFor \nFDR cut-off\n set at 0.001.\n\n\nThis is a significance level (an adjusted p value). We will set it quite low in this example, to ensure we only examine key differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the Parallel Coordinates plot. There are two axes:\n\n\n\n\nLeft: \nControl\n: Gene expression in the control samples. All values are set at zero.\n\n\nRight: \nTreatment\n Gene expression in the treatment samples, relative to expression in the control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blocks of blue and red underneath the plot are called a heatmap.\n\n\n\n\nEach block is a gene. Click on a block to see its line in the plot above.\n\n\nLook at the row for the Treatment. Relative to the control, genes expressed more are red; genes expressed less are blue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\n\nfor an experiment with multiple treatments, the various treatment axes can be dragged to rearrange. There is no natural order (such as a time series).\n\n\n\n\nTable of genes\n\n\n\n\nContig\n: names of genes. Note that gene names are sometimes specific to a species, or they may be only named as a locus ID (a chromosomal location specified in the genome annotation).\n\n\nFDR\n: False Discovery Rate. This is an adjusted p value to show the significance of the difference in gene expression between two conditions. Click on column headings to sort. By default, this table is sorted by FDR.\n\n\nControl\n and \nTreatment\n: log2(Fold Change) of gene expression. The default display is of fold change in the treatment relative to the control. Therefore, values in the \nControl\n column are zero. This can be changed in the \nOptions\n panel at the top right.\n\n\nIn some cases, a large fold change will be meaningful but in others, even a small fold change can be important biologically.\n\n\n\n\nTable of genes and expression:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDGE in Galaxy\n\n\nDifferential gene expression can also be analyzed in Galaxy. The input is the count matrix produced by a tool such as HTSeq-Count (see section above: \nCount reads per gene\n).\n\n\n\n\nIn the \nTools\n panel, search for \nDifferential_Count models\n (don\nt forget the underscore) and click on it.\n\n\nThis has options to use edgeR, DESeq, or Voom.
