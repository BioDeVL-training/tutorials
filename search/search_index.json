There are other ways to get data into Galaxy (not covered in this tutorial): you can upload a file from your computer, and you can import an entire history.\n\n\nChoose a tool and change any settings for your analysis.\n\n\nRun the tool. The output files will be saved at the top of your history.\n\n\nView the output files by clicking on the eye icon.\n\n\nView all your histories and move files between them. Switch to a different history.\n\n\nLog out of your Galaxy server. When you log back in (to the same server), your histories will all be there.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nWell done!

You can download a single dataset, multiple datasets all the way to entire histories.\n\n\nPart 1: Download a dataset\n\n\nThe easiest way to get your data is to download a single dataset from a history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload a single dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA history\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. In the History pane, Click on the name of the file you wish to download. This will expand the filename to show some details about the file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Click the \nDownload button\n. The dataset will now be downloaded to your computer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat this for any other data file you want in this or other histories.\n\n\nPart 2: Download multiple datasets\n\n\nSometimes you may want to download multiple histories at once and doing them one by one can be a pain. Luckily, Galaxy has a mechanism for creating \nCollections\n. For more details about collections and how to create them, see \nthis tutorial\n from the Galaxy Training Network.\n\n\nThe concept is very simple however, we are just going to lump together our files of interest and download them all at once.\n\n\n    \n\n        \nDownload multiple datasets\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nCreate a collection of the files you want.\n- Click on the \nCollections\n button at the top of the history pane (the little checkbox)\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n- This creates some new history pane items: A checkbox next to each file name and some new menu buttons.\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n- Now just select the files you want by clicking on their checkboxes, you can also select them all or select none of them.\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n- Once you have selected everything you want, click the \nfor all selected\n button and then click \nBuild Dataset List\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n- A new interface opens showing you the files you have selected.\n        \n \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \nGive the list a name in the appropraite box and click \nCreate\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n- Click on the \nCollections\n button again (the little checkbox at the top of the history pane) to close the interface and go back to the normal history view.\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n- You will now have a new item in your history, a \ncollection\n of other files.\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nDownload the collection\n \n- Click on the collection name in the history pane to expand it\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n- Click on the \nDownload Collection\n button to download the collection of files as a compressed archive to your computer.\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\nThat\ns it. You can now repeat the process for other files you want to download in other histories.\n\n\nPart 3: Downloading/exporting an entire history\n\n\nThe third way to download data from Galaxy is by \nExporting\n a history in it\ns entirety. This will allow you to download all of the data in a history as well as all of the metadata associated with it such as the tools used, their versions, the parameters chosen etc. It is downloaded as a single file archive. Once downloaded, you can also \nImport\n this history into another Galaxy server.\n\n\nDepending on the size of the files and the complexity of the history, it can take quite some time to create the archive before download. For example it can take over 24 hours to create an archive file of a 50GB history. It may be simpler just to download the individual files of interest as outlined above.\n\n\n    \n\n        \nExporting a history\n\n    \n  \n\n    \n\n        \n- On the history pane, click on the \nhistory menu\n (the cog wheel), then select \nExport History to File\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n- Galaxy will now start archiving the history and making it available for download. In the main Galaxy pane, a message will appear with a download URL. Once the history has been completely archived, the URL can be used to download the history archive file.\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n- Click on the URL to start the download. If it isn\nt ready yet, it will show you the following message.\n- You will need to save the URL and try again later.\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\nAs a guide to how long it can take to produce the archive for downloading:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory size\n\n\nTime to archive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 - 200 MB\n\n\nA few minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 - 2 GB\n\n\n1 - 2 hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50 GB\n\n\nmultiple days\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeleting data from Galaxy\n\n\nOnce you have downloaded everything that you want to keep from your Galaxy account, we strongly encourage you to delete your no longer required histories.\n\n\nDeletion in Galaxy is a two stage process. If you delete something, it actually only gets \nmarked as deleted\n and then is hidden. To actually delete an object you must \npurge\n it from disk. The instructions for how to delete datasets and histories follow.\n\n\nPart 1: Deleting a single dataset\n\n\nThis section will show you how to \ndelete\n and then \npurge\n a single dataset from a history. You can also delete multiple datasets and then purge them all at once.\n\n\n    \n\n        \nDelete a single dataset\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n- Click on the \nDelete\n button on the dataset you wish to delete\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n- The dataset has now disappeared from the history pane and there is a \n1 deleted\n link at the top.\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n- You can see the dataset by clicking on the \n1 deleted\n link at the top of the history pane.\n- This will allow you to either: \nUndelete it\n OR \nPermanently remove it from disk\n by clicking on the appropriate link. \nNote: Once you click on the \npermanently remove it from disk\n link you CANNOT undo it.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nYou can also delete and purge multiple datasets at a time by clicking on the \ndelete\n button on all the datasets you want to remove and then purge them all at once by going to the history menu (the little cog wheel) and selecting \nPurge Deleted Datasets\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Deleting an entire history\n\n\nYou can delete an entire history and purge it from disk by doing the following:\n\n\n    \n\n        \nDelete an entire history\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n- Open the \nSaved Histories\n display by clicking on the history menu (little cog wheel) and selecting \nSaved Histories\n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n- You will now see a list of all of your histories\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n- You can now delete a history by clicking on the grey button with it\ns name near or on the little down arrow.\n- Another little menu will appear.\n- Select \nDelete Permanently\nNote: This will permanently remove the entire history and all of its non shared datasets from disk. It CANNOT be undone.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\nYour history has now been deleted and purged from disk.",

For example, the conditions could be wildtype versus mutant, or two growth conditions. Usually multiple biological replicates are done for each condition - these are needed to separate variation within the condition from that between the conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nInput data: reads and reference\n\n\nRNA-Seq reads\n\n\nA typical experiment will have 2 conditions each with 3 replicates, for a total of 6 samples.\n\n\n\n\nOur RNA-seq reads are from 6 samples in \nFASTQ\n format.\n\n\nWe have single-end reads; so one file per sample.\n\n\nData could also be paired-end reads, and there would be two files per sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese have been reduced to 1% of their original size for this tutorial.\n\n\nThe experiment used the bacteria \nE. coli\n grown in two conditions.\n\n\nFiles labelled \nLB\n are the wildtype\n\n\nFiles labelled \nMG\n have been exposed to 0.5% \nMG - alpha methyglucoside (a sugar solution).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference genome\n\n\nThe reference genomes is in \nFASTA\n format and the gene annotations are in \nGTF\n format.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nFASTA\n file contains the DNA sequence(s) that make up the genome; e.g. the chromosome and any plasmids.\n\n\nThe \nGTF\n file lists the coordinates (position) of each feature. Commonly-annotated features are genes, transcripts and protein-coding sequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpload files to Galaxy\n\n\n\n\nLog in to your Galaxy instance (for example, Galaxy Australia, \nusegalaxy.org.au\n).\n\n\n\n\nUse shared data\n\n\nIf you are using Galaxy Australia, you can import the data from a shared data library.\n\n\nIn the top menu bar, go to \nShared Data\n.\n\n\n\n\nClick on \nData Libraries\n.\n\n\nClick on \nGalaxy Australia Training Material: RNA-Seq: Microbial RNA-Seq\n.\n\n\nTick the boxes next to the nine files.\n\n\nClick the \nTo History\n button, select \nAs Datasets\n.\n\n\nName a new history and click \nImport\n.\n\n\nIn the top menu bar, click \nAnalyze Data\n.\n\n\n[Optional] Next to each file, click on the pencil icon and change (shorten) its name.\n\n\nYou should now have eight files in your current history ready for the analysis, plus an additional \nJBrowse\n file that we will use later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr, import from the web\n\n\n\n\n \nOnly follow this step if unable to load the data files from shared data, as described above.

This suggests that the gene in that condition was more highly expressed.\n\n\nHowever, this needs to be verified with statistical testing, which will be covered in the next parts of this tutorial.\n\n\nCount reads per gene\n\n\nWe now need to count how many reads overlap with particular genes.

(These are quite low as we are using a cut-down data set).\n\n\nWe can\nt just compare the counts directly; they need to be normalized before comparison, and this will be done as part of the DGE analysis in the next step.\n\n\n\n\nTest for differential expression\n\n\nThere are various tools available to test for differential gene expression. In today\ns tutorial, we will use the tool Voom (link to the paper \nhere\n).\n\n\n\n\nIn the \nTools\n panel, search for \nDifferential_Count models\n (don\nt forget the underscore) and click on it.\n\n\nThis has options to use edgeR, DESeq, or Voom. Here we will use Voom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor \nSelect an input matrix\n choose the \ncount matrix\n file generated in the previous step.\n\n\nFor \nTitle for job outputs\n enter \nDGE using voom\n.\n\n\nFor \nSelect columns containing treatment\n tick boxes for the MG samples.\n\n\nFor \nSelect columns containing control\n tick boxes for the LB samples.\n\n\nUnder \nRun this model using edgeR\n choose \nDo not run edgeR\n.\n\n\nUnder \nRun the same model with DESeq2 and compare findings\n choose \nDo not run DESeq2\n.\n\n\nUnder \nRun the same model with Voom/limma and compare findings\n choose \nRun VOOM\n.\n\n\n\n\nYour tool interface should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nExecute\n.\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nThere are two output files. We will look at the file called \nDEGusingvoom_topTable_VOOM.xls\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nContig\n column shows the genes that had transcripts mapped (genes with low counts may be filtered out).\n\n\nThe \nadj.P.Val\n is the statistical significance (p value) adjusted for multiple testing. The table is sorted by this column (most significant to least significant).\n\n\nThe \nlogFC\n is the log2 fold change, which is the change in gene expression between the treatment and control group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the most statistically signifcant result is that the ptsG gene was expressed differently between the two conditions.\n\n\n\n\nIts expression in the treatment group was lower.\n\n\nThe log base 2 change in expression is approximately -4, meaning the difference in expression is approximately 16x.\n\n\n\n\nTo check, let\ns look at the ptsG gene in the original table of counts, the \nbams to DGE count matrix\n.\n\n\n\n\nClick on the eye icon to view.\n\n\nSearch for the ptsG gene (Cmd-F to search on a Mac).\n\n\nDo the read counts look different between the control samples and the treatment samples?\n\n\n\n\nDGE in Degust\n\n\nDegust is a tool on the web that can analyse the counts files produced in the step above, to test for differential gene expression. (Degust can also display the results from DGE analyses performed elsewhere.)\n\n\nUpload counts file\n\n\nGo to the \nDegust web page\n.\n\n\n\n\nClick \nUpload your counts file\n.\n\n\nClick on \nChoose File\n.\n\n\nSelect the \nhtseq output file. tabular\n (that you previously downloaded to your computer from Galaxy) and click \nOpen\n.

This runs Voom/Limma on the uploaded counts.\n\n\n\n\nMDS plot\n\n\nFirst, look at the MDS plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a multidimensional scaling plot which represents the variation between samples.\n\n\nIdeally:\n\n\nAll the LB samples would be close to each other\n\n\nAll the MG samples would be close to each other\n\n\nThe LB and MG groups would be far apart\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe x-axis is the dimension with the highest magnitude. The control/treatment samples should be split along this axis.\n\n\nOur LB samples are on the left and the MG samples are on the right, which means they are well separated on their major MDS dimension, which looks correct.\n\n\n\n\nExpression - MA plot\n\n\nEach dot shows the change in expression in one gene.\n\n\n\n\nThe average expression (over both condition and treatment samples) is represented on the x-axis.\n\n\nPlot points should be symmetrical around the x-axis.\n\n\nWe can see that many genes are expressed at a low level, and some are highly expressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fold change is represented on the y axis.\n\n\nIf expression is significantly different between treatment and control, the dots are red. If not, they are blue. (In Degust, significant means FDR \n0.05).\n\n\nAt low levels of gene expression (low values of the x axis), fold changes are less likely to be significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the dot to see the gene name.     \n\n\n\n\nExpression - Volcano plot\n\n\nAnother way to view expression levels is with the volcano plot.\n\n\n\n\nAs with the MA plot, each dot is a gene.\n\n\nThis time, the logFC axis is horizontal (in the MA plot, it was vertical).\n\n\nThe vertical axis is a measure of statistical significance (-log10 FDR).\n\n\nIf expression is significantly different between treatment and control, the dots are red.
