# Starting with Galaxy

## What is Galaxy?

Galaxy is a web-based analysis and workflow platform.

  * Designed for biologists
  * Easily accessible via a web page
  * Free to use
  * You can upload your own data
  * You can access shared data
  * Use common bioinformatics tools
  * Develop workflows

In this set of tutorials, we are using **Galaxy-Australia**.

* We access Galaxy-Australia by going to a web page with this address: [add address]
* However, there are many different Galaxy servers available. Some of them have a set of general tools, and some have been developed for particular analyses. You can use more than one Galaxy server but you will need to register separately for each one, and they don't share data between them. A list of Galaxy servers is [here](https://galaxyproject.org/public-galaxy-servers/).
* More information about the Galaxy project can be found [here](https://galaxyproject.org/).


The Galaxy-Australia page looks like this:

[replace with Galaxy-Au screenshot]

![galaxy overview screenshot](images/image05.png)

* <ss>Tools</ss> on the left
* <ss>Viewing</ss> panel in the middle
* <ss>History</ss> of analysis and files on the right

## Can I use Galaxy?

Yes!

* Galaxy is free to use and available for everyone.
* Australian researchers may find Galaxy-Australia particularly suited to their analysis needs as it has been developed in consultation with scientists across the country.

## How do I get started?

To use Galaxy-Australia, follow these steps:

* Open your internet browser. Use Firefox, Chrome or Safari (not Internet Explorer).
* Open a new tab.
* In the address bar, type in the address of Galaxy-Australia [add address].

![Register or Login screenshot](images/image04.png)

- Select: <ss>User &rarr; Register</ss>
- Enter your email, choose a password, and choose a user name.
- Click <ss>Submit</ss>

- Login, and refresh the page.

- Each time you use this Galaxy server, log in to see your data and histories.
- You have [amount of storage]
- Your data will stay stored for [amount of time.]
- If you are using a different Galaxy server, you would need to register/log in to that server.

## How to use Galaxy


* Available tools are in the left hand panel. Find the tool you want or use the search bar at the top of the tools.

* Click on the tool you want to use.

* The tool interface will appear in the centre Galaxy panel. Check the settings.

* Click <ss>Execute</ss>.

* When the tool has finished, output file(s) will appear at the top of your "Current History" in the right hand panel.

* Click on the eye icon next to a file to view it.

* To access older histories, use the button at the top right of the History panel.

## Exercise 1

### Name your current history

name

enter

### Upload a file

from Zenodo

e.g. 1 x fastQ file - download to your computer
Galaxy - get data - upload file - choose local file

### Use a tool

e.g. FASTQC

### View results

click on file name


## Exercise 2

### Create a new history

### Import some data

from Zenodo

e.g. 2 x fastq files

change the file name

change the file type

Use a tool - e.g. Pear

View results


## Exercise 3

### Import a history

add a simple history to Galaxy Au

import

e.g. 2 x fastq files and a reference genome

Use a tool - e.g. freebayes

then filter results

View results


## Exercise 4

### Re-run a tool

with changed settings.

## Exercise 5

### Look at all your histories

create a new history

you can drag files between histories

drag some files in

back to main page with "Analyze data"


## Summary

What have we learned?

* The Galaxy interface has tools on the left, viewing pane in the middle, and a history of your data analysis on the right.
* You can create a new history for each analysis. All your histories are saved.
* Upload data from your computer or from a web address.
* You can also upload data (and analyses) by importing a history.
* Choose a tool and change any settings for your analysis.
* Run the tool. The output files will be saved at the top of your history.
* View the output files by clicking on the eye icon.
* Log

## Move this stuff:

[move this stuff below into the relevant individual workshops, to import a history for each of them: ]



## Import a shared history

For Galaxy-Australia users, import the following history:

[add this history to Galaxy-Au]

* In Galaxy, go to the top menu bar
* Click on <ss>Shared Data</ss>

* From the drop down menu, click on <ss>Histories</ss>

[update image]

<img src="images/shared_data.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 500px;"/>

* From the list of Published Histories, click <fn>Genomics-workshop</ss>

[update or re-name this history as appropriate]
[update image]

![published histories](images/hist.png)


* In the top right, click on <ss>Import history</ss>

<img src="images/import.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 400px;"/>

* This history will now be in your "Current history" - the right hand pane in Galaxy.
* There should be six files. (The number in front of the file name is not important.)

* We will use these files for the Genomics Workshop. For additional ways to import histories, see below.














Copy this link:

<tt>https://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_377/public/Microbial_tutorials/Galaxy_history_input_files.tar.gz</tt>

- Click on the <ss>History</ss> cog ![cog icon](images/image02.png)
- Select <ss>Import from File</ss>

![history options](images/import_from_file.png)

- In the box called <ss>Archived History URL</ss>, paste in the link address to the Galaxy history (that you copied above).
- Click <ss>Submit</ss>
- Wait a few seconds.
- Click on the <ss>view all histories</ss> button ![histories icon](images/view_all_hist.png)
- See if the Galaxy history has been imported: it will be called <fn>imported from archive: Data</fn>
- Above that pane, click on the <ss>Switch to</ss> button.
- Then click <ss>Done</ss> (in the top left corner).
- You should now have a list of five files in your current history. We will use these for the Genomics Workshop; or see below for additional files.
