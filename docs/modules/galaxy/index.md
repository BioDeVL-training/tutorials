# Starting with Galaxy

## What is Galaxy?

Galaxy is a web-based analysis and workflow platform.

  * Designed for biologists
  * Upload your data
  * Access shared data
  * Use common bioinformatics tools
  * Develop workflows
  * Access via a web page
  * Free

In this set of tutorials, we are using Galaxy-Australia.

* We access Galaxy-Australia by going to a web page with this address: [add address]
* However, there are many different Galaxy servers available [add list].
* More information about the Galaxy project can be found [here](https://galaxyproject.org/).


The Galaxy-Australia page looks like this:

[replace with Galaxy-Au screenshot]

![galaxy overview screenshot](images/image05.png)

* <ss>Tools</ss> on the left
* <ss>Viewing</ss> panel in the middle
* <ss>History</ss> of analysis and files on the right

## Can I use Galaxy?

Yes!

* Galaxy is free to use and available for everyone.
* Australian researchers may find Galaxy-Australia particularly suited to their analysis needs as it has been developed in consultation with scientists across the country.

## How do I get started?

To use Galaxy-Australia, follow these steps:

* Open your internet browser. Use Firefox, Chrome or Safari (not Internet Explorer).
* Open a new tab.
* In the address bar, type in the address of Galaxy-Australia [add address].

- Each time you use this Galaxy server, log in to see your data and histories.
- You have [amount of storage]
- Your data will stay stored for [amount of time.]
- If you are using a different Galaxy server, you would need to register/log in to that server.

## Move this stuff:

[move this stuff below into the relevant individual workshops, to import a history for each of them: ]



## Import a shared history

For Galaxy-Australia users, import the following history:

[add this history to Galaxy-Au]

* In Galaxy, go to the top menu bar
* Click on <ss>Shared Data</ss>

* From the drop down menu, click on <ss>Histories</ss>

[update image]

<img src="images/shared_data.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 500px;"/>

* From the list of Published Histories, click <fn>Genomics-workshop</ss>

[update or re-name this history as appropriate]
[update image]

![published histories](images/hist.png)


* In the top right, click on <ss>Import history</ss>

<img src="images/import.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 400px;"/>

* This history will now be in your "Current history" - the right hand pane in Galaxy.
* There should be six files. (The number in front of the file name is not important.)

[update image]

<img src="images/currenthist.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/>

* We will use these files for the Genomics Workshop. For additional ways to import histories, see below.


## How to use Galaxy


* Available tools are in the left hand panel. Find the tool you want or use the search bar at the top of the tools.

* Click on the tool you want to use.

* The tool interface will appear in the centre Galaxy panel. Check the settings.

* Click <ss>Execute</ss>.

* When the tool has finished, output file(s) will appear at the top of your "Current History" in the right hand panel.

* Click on the eye icon next to a file to view it.

* To access older histories, use the button at the top right of the History panel.









## Alternative file import information

<!-- - In the menu options across the top, go to <ss>Shared Data</ss>.
- Click on <ss>Histories</ss>.

![Shared histories](images/image10.png)

- A list of published histories should appear. Click on the history that you want to use.

<!--For the Genomics Workshop, click on this one:

![histories](images/pub_hist.png)


- A useful starting history is a set of files containing sequencing reads and reference genomes.
- Click on **Genomics-files**.

- Then click on <ss>Import history</ss>.
- An option will appear to re-name the history. We don't need to rename it, so click <ss>Import</ss>.
- The history will now appear in your Current History pane, and the files are ready to use in Galaxy analyses.

- *Note: if this history is not available in your version of Galaxy, please see the [following page](../data-dna/index.md) for links and information about uploading data.*

Copy this link:

<tt>https://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_377/public/Microbial_tutorials/Galaxy_history_input_files.tar.gz</tt>

- Click on the <ss>History</ss> cog ![cog icon](images/image02.png)
- Select <ss>Import from File</ss>

![history options](images/import_from_file.png)

- In the box called <ss>Archived History URL</ss>, paste in the link address to the Galaxy history (that you copied above).
- Click <ss>Submit</ss>
- Wait a few seconds.
- Click on the <ss>view all histories</ss> button ![histories icon](images/view_all_hist.png)
- See if the Galaxy history has been imported: it will be called <fn>imported from archive: Data</fn>
- Above that pane, click on the <ss>Switch to</ss> button.
- Then click <ss>Done</ss> (in the top left corner).
- You should now have a list of five files in your current history. We will use these for the Genomics Workshop; or see below for additional files.
